# Write a method for determining if a year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
# The system is to check if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
# For example, 1896, 1904, and 2000 were leap years but 1900 was not.

# Write a function that takes in a year as input and returns True if the year is a leap year, return False otherwise.
# Note: background on leap year https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year

# The name of the method should be isleapyear and the method should take one parameter which is the year to test.

# Here is an example call to the function:

# mybirthyear = 2000

# If isleapyear(mybirthyear):

#     print(“Year {0} was a leap year”.format(mybirthyear))


def isleapyear(year):
    is_leap = False
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (
        year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 == 0
    ):
        is_leap = True
    return is_leap


# print(isleapyear(1896))
